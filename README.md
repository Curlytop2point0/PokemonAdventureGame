# Overview

My name is Maxim Person, and as a software engineer, I strive to deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming and interactive application development by creating a Pokémon Adventure Game using Java. This project demonstrates the core concepts of Java programming, such as variables, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and the use of the Java Collection Framework.

The purpose of this software is to simulate a text-based Pokémon world where players can explore wild areas, encounter and capture Pokémon and build their own team. This game serves as a tool for reinforcing proper Java syntax, leveraging object-oriented principles, and practicing effective use of collections, all while offering an engaging and nostalgic experience.
